      <description>My first website was made using hugo. I do not have any prior experience in making any website using HTML or even CSS. I had a little hard time understanding things, so i had to refer some youtube videos that helped me understand things more deeper.
I was not totally new to building a website. What i knew was that html had tags that adds text and images to the website and css gives crazy desigsns to it.</description>
