My first website was made using hugo.
I do not have any prior experience in making any website using HTML or even CSS.
I had a little hard time understanding things, so i had to refer some youtube videos that helped me understand things more deeper.

I was not totally new to building a website. What i knew was that html had tags that adds text and images to the website and css gives crazy desigsns to it. But dealing with Hugo was much easier and quicker to understand.

I worked with the config.toml file and yml file, where I understood is the place where I add my social links to my website.  

I chose the 'PaperMod' theme since it looked simple enough for a beginner like me.Therefore the .yml file handling came in handy as i used it here. I tried quite different things and have finally finished my first website successfully.
I kind of started to like what i'm doing right now...
